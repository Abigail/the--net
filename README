INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   - Copy Net.pm to .../site_perl/version/The/Net.pm
   - run pod2man Net.pm and install it in your mandir.

You might want to ask why the usual 'perl Makefile.PL' isn't going to
work. That's because modern MakeMakers insist on an exact number of
spaces and dashes in the NAME section of the POD documentation. A space
or a dash too many AND AN IMPORTANT WARNING SHALL BE ISSUED.

Fsckers.
